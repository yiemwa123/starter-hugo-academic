title: Studio Ghibli Movie Catalog
summary: This one of my first front-end web development projects where I made an interactive Studio Ghibli movie catalog (as you might be able to tell from my current profile picture, I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan :)). This was coded on my own. Please don't delete movies or tags when playing around with the website; otherwise I'll have to go back and add the information again.

__Timeline__: April 2020

### Objectives of this assignment
* Design and implement an online photo gallery in PHP
* Design an aesthetically pleasing and usable interactive site 
* Photo gallery should be backed by a database which you will use to store information about the images uploaded to your gallery
* Organize the photos in the gallery by allowing users of the site to tag the photos.

I decided to put my own spin on the idea of a photo gallery by turning the website into a collection of Studio Ghibli movies. The photos in my case were the Studio Ghibli movie posters.

### Functionality
* View all images in the gallery at once. 
* View all images for a tag at once. 
* View a single image and all the tags for that image at once. 
* Upload a new image.
* Remove (delete) an image.
* View all tags at once.
* Add an existing tag to an image, add a new tag to an image, and remove a tag from an image.

__Deleting and adding tags, deleting movie entry__

### Reflection
There definitely could be some improvements to the aesthetics and usability of this website. Some major changes that I would make are:

* __Create an edit button for each movie and give the user the opportunity to delete the movie on the editing page and modify/delete tags.__ Having the delete button show up while hovering over the title of the movie or the tags is confusing. I think at the time my thinking was that it is common for users to be able to hover over specific images and more actions would be available.   
* __Display the tags differently.__ For instance, on YouTube, underneath the search bar there is a list of keywords that the user can click on and it will display results for that tag. 
* __Improve the search functionality.__ If I could do this over, I would allow the user to be able to search movies without having to type in the whole title; rather if they type a word that matches a word in the movie title, the movie would still show up in the search results. 
* __Conduct user testing__ to see what users might think of these changes and the overall usability and aesthetics of my website.

All in all this project was a good way for me to practice my front-end web development and design skills.
