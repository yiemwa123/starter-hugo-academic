We were fortunate that Cornell’s campus was open to students during the pandemic. However, most classes were online and in-person events were limited to small gatherings. In these conditions, it can be difficult for new undergraduate students to meet people and make friends even though they were all in close proximity to each other.

Project goal:
The goal of this project is to design a solution that makes it easier for new students to meet one another and help them build a community of close friends.

Target user group:
New undergraduate students at Cornell including freshmen and transfer students who are on campus.
Overview of the final solution:
Myself, as well as two other classmates, designed an app that helps students navigate the competitive club recruitment process (more on club recruitment later).

User Research (Part I)
We conducted interviews with 3 new undergraduate students to understand their current experiences with making friends on campus and what they look for in a friend.

Key insights:
Interviewees were limited to meeting friends through mutual connections.
Interviewees reported preferring friends who shared the same interest, values and have genuine personalities. Most noted that they still value people with shared values over shared interests, but it is easier to connect if there are shared interests.
Interviewees reported to use Facebook to add an extensive network of friends whereas Snapchat and Instagram were used to chat directly with a select group of friends, sometimes leading to in-person meetings. However, it is important to note that all interviewees used multiple different platforms to connect with people.

What is the current solution space missing?
No virtual to in-person meet-up conversion in one solution
Harder to get to know someone on a deeper level
More difficult to create a support network online compared to in-person

Brainstorming:
We each came up with 10 design ideas and narrowed down the 30 different design ideas to a list of 5 ideas. However, after seeking feedback, we realized that our ideas were similar to existing solutions, but more importantly our design ideas stemmed from surface-level insights and didn’t properly address a core issue within our user base. In order to gain additional insight, we conducted another round of user research.

User Research (Part II)
A key insight that we uncovered during this round of user research was:

The difficulty that new students faced in joining competitive clubs. Users had hoped to make friends by joining clubs, only to not be able to participate in them.

Back to Brainstorming

With the new insight in mind, our group realized that our persona has made unsuccessful efforts towards joining communities and making new friends through club recruitment because of the lack of understanding of the recruitment process, misinterpretation of club culture, and the lack of prior connections within the club. Although “coffee chat” opportunities exist for prospective applicants, some interviewees mentioned that coffee chats are intimidating and that conversations are often transactional and surface level.

We decided upon a design idea that matches users to clubs based on interests and desired club culture and a chat function that allows users to speak and complete a virtual or in-person activity with a club officer. Existing solutions such as virtual ClubFest/CampusGroups and Taro Chat fail to effectively provide this avenue in which users can genuinely connect with club officers and break into competitive clubs.
