Hi! I'm Emma, a recent graduate from Cornell University with a B.S in Information Science with concentrations in User Experience and Interactive Technologies. My primary research interests lie in human-AI interaction (HAI) and making AI more understandable and available to those with no background in ML to help people make better decisions. I hope to be able to apply this in social good domains, such as health, accessibility, and education.\
